# GF Reskin

I'm a member at [guitarforums.com](https://www.guitarforums.com) and this is just a little project to keep my files and tasks to be used in conjuction with [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en) to reskin the site for me while viewing it.

This reskin does the following:

- Changes colors to some that go together better
- Changes fonts to something more pleasing
- Changes icons to something more modern and flat
- Adds shadows and removes some borders

$ cd gfResking
$ npm i
$ npm run compile
```

## To just use my theme on your machine:
